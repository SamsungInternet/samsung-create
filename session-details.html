        <h3>PWA, Native Apps, oh my! Making sense of the evolving web app landscape</h3>
        <p>We all love web code, but there is only so much you can do in the browser. Native apps allow you to do more,
          but trying to shoehorn web code into a native experience historically hasn't served our users well. Things
          are different now. As it turns out, we no longer have to compromise between a great user experience and our
          familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In this talk, we’ll work to make sense of the evolving web app landscape. We'll cover everything from
          Progressive Web Apps to React Native to Electron to HWAs, and look at how you can maintain one web code base
          while still ensuring your apps run brilliantly both in your browser as well as natively on iOS, Android, and
          desktop devices.</p>

        <h3>The Hateful Weight</h3>
        <p>Web development and the technologies employed are complex. What is not a Gordian knot is image weight.
          Image weight is oft a red herring of poor management resulting in poor #ux, along with dissolution of users’
          data plans. With the world moving from mostly to near exclusively, data sensitive mobile clients, image
          optimization is crucial component of asset management. Making learned decisions about images is critical,
          from formats to art direction. The Hateful Weight will discuss:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formats, new and old.</li>
          <li>Their strengths and short comings</li>
          <li>The tools and strategies to oversee their optimizations</li>
          <li>And the need to address a varied and worldly audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the denouement, attendees will have a much better understanding and grasp of image formats, the need for
          their management and optimization and the urgent necessity to consider and build for new markets.</p>
