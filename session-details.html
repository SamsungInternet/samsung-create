        <h3>PWA, Native Apps, oh my! Making sense of the evolving web app landscape</h3>
        <p>We all love web code, but there is only so much you can do in the browser. Native apps allow you to do more,
          but trying to shoehorn web code into a native experience historically hasn't served our users well. Things
          are different now. As it turns out, we no longer have to compromise between a great user experience and our
          familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In this talk, we’ll work to make sense of the evolving web app landscape. We'll cover everything from
          Progressive Web Apps to React Native to Electron to HWAs, and look at how you can maintain one web code base
          while still ensuring your apps run brilliantly both in your browser as well as natively on iOS, Android, and
          desktop devices.</p>

          story of how Progressive Web App technology came to the rescue for InspireHUB clients,  what the team learned
          about using bleeding edge technology and how a small, unknown, scrappy group of devs ended up being the first
          to do a whole lot of cool stuff.</p>

        <h3>Mixed Reality: Where the virtual world meets IoT</h3>
        <p>Virtual Reality and the Internet of Things are two of the most important technologies that arise in the past
          years. VR has the potential to change the world in some surprising ways, while Internet of Things already has
          transformed the way we live our lives. It is the confluence of these two technologies, that offers the most
          promising opportunity of all. In this talk, we'll introduce Samsung's big vision on IoT. How we build Samsung
          ARTIK from Module to Cloud and how we combine IoT and webVR to connect the real world to virtual reality.</p>

        <p>WebXR will expand upon the capabilities of the immersive web. But you do not have to wait for the official
          release of WebXR to create WebAR projects. You can achieve WebAR experiences with current Web APIs and open
          source libraries. In this talk, I will talk about recreating Pokemon Go on the web and adding more
          complicated AR features, such as marker tracking and facial tracking.</p>

        <p>AR on the web is coming. There are already experiments that expose advanced AR capabilities using web
          technologies and the WebXR standard is starting to include AR capabilities. In this talk the current status
          of these prototypes will be shown along with some demos built on top of them. But, what is the future of AR
          on the Web and why is it important? All these questions and more will be exposed and tried to be answered.</p>

        <p>Thousands of companies keep track of just about everything we do online. As news of major security breaches
          and privacy violations go mainstream, increasing consumer demand and regulation seem to be on the verge of
          significantly changing the internet as we know it. This talk will explore the past, present, and future state

        <h3>Getting To Grips With CSS Grid</h3>
        <p>CSS grid finally brings 2D layouts to CSS, with some incredibly powerful tools for creating beautiful
          responsive layouts. We’ll start with the basics of Grid and then explore how to build some common layouts
          that you’ll see often around the web, along with some advice on what grid is not for!</p>
        <p>We’ll take a trip through the history of web layout from tables to flex to learn the good the bad and the
          ugly of coding up a design and the problems that grid can fix. We’ll then cover the basic language of Grid
          and Grid composition using some responsive layouts as examples; finishing with the ‘holy grail’ layout built
          in 5 lines of CSS. Grid, however, isn’t here to kill all other layout methods so it is worth mentioning that
          other tools, such as flex, are still very useful and valid. We’ll then go on to cover some more advanced uses
          of Grid such as template area naming and how and why we might implement a subgrid-like effect using
          <code>display:contents</code>.</p>

        <h3>The Hateful Weight</h3>
        <p>Web development and the technologies employed are complex. What is not a Gordian knot is image weight.
          Image weight is oft a red herring of poor management resulting in poor #ux, along with dissolution of users’
          data plans. With the world moving from mostly to near exclusively, data sensitive mobile clients, image
          optimization is crucial component of asset management. Making learned decisions about images is critical,
          from formats to art direction. The Hateful Weight will discuss:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formats, new and old.</li>
          <li>Their strengths and short comings</li>
          <li>The tools and strategies to oversee their optimizations</li>
          <li>And the need to address a varied and worldly audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the denouement, attendees will have a much better understanding and grasp of image formats, the need for
          their management and optimization and the urgent necessity to consider and build for new markets.</p>

        <h3>Documenting the Web on MDN</h3>
        <p>Every month, millions of web developers come to MDN for information about JavaScript, Web API’s, CSS and
          other core web technologies. Over the last 12 years, the MDN team, along with thousands of volunteers, has
          documented evolving web standards, browser compatibility, and helped new developers learn about web
          technologies.</p>
        <p>In this talk, we’ll dive into new features and content, and look at how and the collaboration between
          Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, the W3C and others on the MDN Product Advisory board is helping maintain
          a cross-browser focus, as well as what to expect in the future.</p>

        <h3>Game mechanics powered by the Gaze-At-Ratio (GAR)</h3>
        <p>Learn how content creators and publishers can measure a user's depth of attention and engagement to 3D
          objects in both VR/AR environments without disrupting the content or the user experience, and then employ that
          metric for various applications like A/B testing, content triggering, and monetization. One approach is
          powered by the Gaze-At-Ratio (GAR), an algorithm that determines the value of a user's gaze to a 3D object by
          factoring in the relative distance, duration, and depth of a user’s orientation as the object enters and
          exits their field of view.</p>
