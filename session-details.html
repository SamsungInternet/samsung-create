        <h3>PWA, Native Apps, oh my! Making sense of the evolving web app landscape</h3>
        <p>We all love web code, but there is only so much you can do in the browser. Native apps allow you to do more,
          but trying to shoehorn web code into a native experience historically hasn't served our users well. Things
          are different now. As it turns out, we no longer have to compromise between a great user experience and our
          familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In this talk, we’ll work to make sense of the evolving web app landscape. We'll cover everything from
          Progressive Web Apps to React Native to Electron to HWAs, and look at how you can maintain one web code base
          while still ensuring your apps run brilliantly both in your browser as well as natively on iOS, Android, and
          desktop devices.</p>

        <h3>Progressive Web Apps to the Rescue</h3>
        <p>When InspireHUB was founded in 2013 it was immediately retained by the Mandela family to help use technology
          to fight the pediatric healthcare crisis in South Africa.  In this talk, Co-Founder Karolyn Hart shares the
          story of how Progressive Web App technology came to the rescue for InspireHUB clients,  what the team learned
          about using bleeding edge technology and how a small, unknown, scrappy group of devs ended up being the first
          to do a whole lot of cool stuff.</p>

        <h3>Getting To Grips With CSS Grid</h3>
        <p>CSS grid finally brings 2D layouts to CSS, with some incredibly powerful tools for creating beautiful
          responsive layouts. We’ll start with the basics of Grid and then explore how to build some common layouts
          that you’ll see often around the web, along with some advice on what grid is not for!</p>
        <p>We’ll take a trip through the history of web layout from tables to flex to learn the good the bad and the
          ugly of coding up a design and the problems that grid can fix. We’ll then cover the basic language of Grid
          and Grid composition using some responsive layouts as examples; finishing with the ‘holy grail’ layout built
          in 5 lines of CSS. Grid, however, isn’t here to kill all other layout methods so it is worth mentioning that
          other tools, such as flex, are still very useful and valid. We’ll then go on to cover some more advanced uses
          of Grid such as template area naming and how and why we might implement a subgrid-like effect using
          <code>display:contents</code>.</p>

        <h3>Web Bluetooth for Fun and Profit</h3>
        <p>The Web is moving into the physical world. Wearables, sensors, even drones... the availability of Bluetooth
          Low Energy in our smartphones is driving a 'connected devices' revolution. Using the Web Bluetooth API, we
          can start controlling the world around us, with no native code required.</p>

        <h3>The Hateful Weight</h3>
        <p>Web development and the technologies employed are complex. What is not a Gordian knot is image weight.
          Image weight is oft a red herring of poor management resulting in poor #ux, along with dissolution of users’
          data plans. With the world moving from mostly to near exclusively, data sensitive mobile clients, image
          optimization is crucial component of asset management. Making learned decisions about images is critical,
          from formats to art direction. The Hateful Weight will discuss:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Formats, new and old.</li>
          <li>Their strengths and short comings</li>
          <li>The tools and strategies to oversee their optimizations</li>
          <li>And the need to address a varied and worldly audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the denouement, attendees will have a much better understanding and grasp of image formats, the need for
          their management and optimization and the urgent necessity to consider and build for new markets.</p>

          community, co-programming meetups including the Toronto Web Performance Group or volunteering his time for
          lunch and learns at various bootcamps. Otherwise, he’s riding track bikes, tooling with music production

        <h3>Game mechanics powered by the Gaze-At-Ratio (GAR)</h3>
        <p>Learn how content creators and publishers can measure a user's depth of attention and engagement to 3D
          objects in both VR/AR environments without disrupting the content or the user experience, and then employ that
          metric for various applications like A/B testing, content triggering, and monetization. One approach is
          powered by the Gaze-At-Ratio (GAR), an algorithm that determines the value of a user's gaze to a 3D object by
          factoring in the relative distance, duration, and depth of a user’s orientation as the object enters and
          exits their field of view.</p>
